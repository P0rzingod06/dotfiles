NOTES

-- Altered demo gear upload package in dev to include more logging for this child item has no master item
-- it is an oracle error that can be googled.  Says need to update master org before child org.
-- Need data in dev that throws same error.

--select max (msib.inventory_item_id)
                 from  mtl_system_items_b msib
                where 1=1
                  AND msib.organization_id = cp_org_id
                  AND msib.segment2 = wdgie.manufacturer_part_number
                  AND msib.segment4 = cp_segment4
-- This query doesn't return something which is why the duplicate item error is thrown - "Duplicate item UCAPPS-SW-10-X-K9 found in segment2 on table apps.mtl_system_items_b" -- this means item already exists.
