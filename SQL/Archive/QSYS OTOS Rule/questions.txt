How do you look for errors once a file processes?
 -- So this one isn't a GUC process.  It's is still part of the old ftp process - all shell scripts on Unix.  Would be worth thinking about switching over to GUC at some point.  Although, it wouldn't be a small change.  
 -- As far as checking for errors.  You could look at the nasa_sewp_import/wwt_nasa_sewp_files table to see if it is showing the file contents/file there.  The logs are written to the unix server so theres no way to check those without unix access(which is different than GUC where they are written out to an oracle table).
 -- This is the email list which errors are sent to:

SELECT *
FROM ALERT_SUBSCRIPTIONS
WHERE subscription = 'NASA_SEWP_PARTS_LOAD'
AND active = 'Y'

 What table does the file get loaded to stage it before approval?   
 -- will get sent to WWT_NASA_SEWP_FILES with a status of SUBMITTED.  Once it is approved status will get changed to APPROVED.

 --TR report is then sent to a distribution list which is stored on the unix server in a properties file.  Only way to update this would be on unix itself.  name of file is: email.env -- Here is a list of the current values:

 		NASASEWP="brian.biederman@wwt.com drew.dolan@wwt.com sean.orourke@wwt.com"
		NASASEWP_dev="josh.deppermann@wwt.com Matt.Derhake@wwt.com Megan.Dirks@wwt.com Michael.Gassert@wwt.com"
		NASASEWP_test="josh.deppermann@wwt.com Matt.Derhake@wwt.com Megan.Dirks@wwt.com Michael.Gassert@wwt.com"

How long does it take for it to show up in LOV for request below?
--Not sure what this question is asking.  How long will the nasa_sewp package take to run? -runs once every 5 minutes.  Should only take at most 30 seconds to run but most of the time should run in under 10 seconds.  The email doesn't get sent right away so it might take longer to receive the email. 

What if the file is not in the LOV on the Request?
-- Again not exactly sure what this is asking.  Anything dropped in the directory will be uploaded to nasa_sewp_files table awaiting approval as well as being uploaded to the wwt_nasa_sewp table.  Will upload to wwt_nasa_sewp if the pricing check passes, clin is not null, filename has not been encountered before.
